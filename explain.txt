✅ 1. What each HTML element does?

 Explain:  <h1> to <h6> - Used to define headings with different sizes.
            <form> - Used to create an input form for collecting user data.
            <input type="text"> - Used to take user’s name as text input.
            <input type="range"> - To take a satisfaction value between a range.


✅ 2. Why you chose specific input types?

 Explain:  I used <input type="email"> for email to ensure proper email validation.
           I used <input type="tel"> with pattern for mobile number to accept 10 digits only.
           I used <select> for choosing favorite language as a dropdown menu.
           I added <input type="date"> for date of birth to allow date selection from calendar.


✅ 3. How your navigation structure works?

Explain:  I created three HTML files: portfolio.html, about.html, contact.html.
          Each file has a navigation menu using <nav> and <a> tags to move between pages.
          The nav bar allows users to easily jump from one page to another.
